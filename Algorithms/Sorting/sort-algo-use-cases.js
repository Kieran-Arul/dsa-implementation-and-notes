WHAT SORT TO USE

- Small input array or data mostly already sorted: Insertion Sort

- Concerned about worst case scenarios occurring: Merge Sort

- Concerned about space and not so concerned about worst case: Quick Sort

- Concerned about space and worst case scenarios occurring: Heap Sort (though on average it is slower than quick sort)
