GRAPH AND TREE TRAVERSALS

- Sometimes if our data is stored in a graph or a tree, we need to traverse over every node to do something to each of them individually

- Sometimes, especially with graphs, we want to establish how far away each node is from another

- It is not as easy to do this as in a list because the data is laid out in a different way, hence the need for different algorithms

- The 2 main algorithms that are used for graph/tree traversals are Breadth-first Search (BFS) and Depth-first Search (DFS)

- The main reason we would want to use graphs or trees to store data rather than a list, which would make traversals easier, is that with graphs and trees we can take advantage of the O(log n) search time

- Graphs and trees are usually used when we want to search nodes or visit every node. They are also very useful because they model a lot of the data we see in the real world
