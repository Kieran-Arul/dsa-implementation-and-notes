TREES OVERVIEW

- Trees are a data structure that have a hierarchical structure

- Similar to other data structures such as stacks, queues or linked lists, they are made up of nodes

- The difference is that linked lists, queues etc have a linear structure (i.e. only one path can be taken)

- The nodes in trees on the other hand are laid out in a hierarchy where multiple paths can be taken from the root node

- I.e. Nodes in a tree can either be:

    - Root node (No parent node - top layer node)
    - Parent node (Node that has some descendants)
    - Sibling (Nodes that are children of the same parent)
    - Child node (Node that is a descendant of another node)
    - Leaf (Node with no children/descendants)

- Each tree can have many sub-trees

- Nodes in a tree can only point to a child (i.e. point downwards)
