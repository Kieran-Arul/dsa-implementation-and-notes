/*

DOUBLY LINKED LIST OVERVIEW

- A doubly linked list differs from a singly linked list in that instead of only having a pointer to the next node, it also has a pointer to the previous node

- In a doubly linked list we can traverse the list from the head to the tail, as well as, from the tail to the head

- In a doubly linked list, both node.next and node.prev are valid methods
